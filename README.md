# DataStore codelab

Supporting code for [Preferences DataStore codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-preferences-datastore/#0) and [Proto DataStore codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-proto-datastore/#0).

DataStore is a new and improved data storage solution aimed at replacing SharedPreferences. Built on Kotlin coroutines and Flow, DataStore provides two different implementations: Proto DataStore, that lets you store typed objects (backed by protocol buffers) and Preferences DataStore, that stores key-value pairs. Data is stored asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally, overcoming some of the drawbacks of SharedPreferences.
